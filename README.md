### What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of state management, reusable components, and styling in React.

- **Styled Components:** Leveraged styled components for reusable and flexible styling, enabling dynamic content and event handling without cumbersome props.

- **Compound Components Pattern:** Implemented compound components to simplify state management and enhance reusability, particularly useful for modal implementations.

- **Context API:** Used Context API to manage cart state, avoiding props drilling and ensuring seamless state access and mutation across the component tree.

- **React Portal:** Utilized for elements that need to appear above other elements, such as modals, context menus, and toasts. createPortal() allows placing these elements at any position in the DOM tree while maintaining their position in the React component tree.
